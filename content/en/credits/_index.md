I had to copy, reference and borrow ideas from people much cleverer and skilled than I to get this blog to look as it does. This page is a space for me to credit them and link back to them.

# Blog Design

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): The markdown based blogging system that makes this site work at all.
- [Ananke Theme for Hugo](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke): The theme I used to style this site.
