The only constant is change. It is one of the few things that is paradoxically a constant.

Paradox is at the heart of our existence and beautifully encapsulated in the Chinese philosophy of Taoism.

This is a space for me to explore my thoughts, to track my own evolution as my ideas run up against the real world and are changed. Many of them will be flawed, many of them will be downright wrong, but I will do my best to update things as my understanding evolves.

Whether it's tech, martial arts, politics, or figuring out my kids, I hope you'll enjoy some of the posts here and that they will impact your thinking too.

Welcome.
