# Introduction

This page is a living resource of books I encounter that I recommend people read if they are interested in agility/devops (technical) coaching.

The accompanying blurbs should give you an idea of what I got of the book and why I recommend it.

# Essential Reading

These are books I return to frequently for inspiration and refreshing my ideas.

This is a must read for any coach working in the agility/DevOps space. While the book has a technical-sounding title, it is very accessibly written and, in my opinion, really captures the core ideals of agility and agile teams.
