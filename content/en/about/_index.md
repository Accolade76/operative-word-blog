There are more important topics in the world than the ones I’ll be writing about. The anthropocene climate change that is transforming our natural ecosystems is about to transform our political and environmental landscape. The insecurity of an increasingly complex world is spawning reactionary tribalism in communities around the world. In a time when we should be coming together, learning from each other, celebrating our differences and facing these challenges together, we are squabbling over stale scraps like crows over a discarded happy meal.

Still, I believe in our potential, our ability to rise to meet our challenges and to show the compassion and grace we will all need to weather the future ahead of us.

This blog is about whatever topic moves me: it can be activism, impassioned rhetoric, tech, philosophy and perhaps even the occasional poetic verse.

I’ll try to distinguish my content by using the appropriate tags to classify it so you can quickly filter on the content that interests you.
