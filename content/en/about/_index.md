Briefly, I am a husband and a father of two. My prononuns are he/him.  I work as a consultant, currently focused on agile/DevOps coaching and I'm working on improving my technical coaching skills.

My interests are broad, as this blog will reflect. I suggest, if you're interested in my writing, to make use of the tags available to filter out content that doesn't interest you.

I believe strongly in the values of Humanism and I think we will only overcome the challenges ahead of us by showing some kindness, selflessness and trying to look after each other (perhaps even more than we look after ourselves).

No one is infallible and I reserve the right to update, change or take down posts to reflect my updated understanding of a subject.

All opinions stated on this site (unless I’ve been hacked) are mine and mine alone, they do not reflect the opinion(s) of my employer or customers.
