Briefly, I am a husband and a father of two.

My prononuns are he/him.

I work as a consultant, currently focused on agile/DevOps coaching and I'm working on improving my technical coaching skills.

Outside of my job, I enjoy writing, reading, spending time with my family, martial arts, coding, experimenting with film making, discussing philosophy, math, history & literature, playing (video) games, getting in shape, travelling, bantering on social media, goofing around on podcasts, and many more things. Any and all of these topics might make it into a blog post.

Where do I find the time? Heck if I know. Mostly, I don't. But occasionally I'll bite stubbornly into a project and not let go until it's done.

I think it's important to be kind, and to consider your responsibilities and not just your rights. I don't think the world is a zero-sum game, where winning is the pinnacle of achievement. I believe strongly in the values of Humanism and I think we will only overcome the challenges ahead of us by showing some kindness, selflessness and trying to look after each other (perhaps even more than we look after ourselves).

No one is infallible and I reserve the right to update, change or take down posts to reflect my updated understanding of a subject.

All opinions stated on this site (unless I’ve been hacked) are mine and mine alone, they do not reflect the opinion(s) of my employer or customers.
